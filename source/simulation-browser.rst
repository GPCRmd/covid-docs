Our Browse_ page provides an easy and quick tool to search for any simulation in our platform. Use the `Search` input to filter out the simulations shown at the table. It is possible to search by any of the terms included in the table (Included proteins, Uniprot entry name, Uniprot ID, etc.). 

The table rows contain a summary of the most important features of the simulations. This includes links to further details of the receptor and molecules present in the simulated system. Click on "Open" to visualize and analyze the simulation with our Workbench_ page. There, you will also find the details of the simulation, as well as links to download the simulation data.
