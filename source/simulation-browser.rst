Simulation search
==================

------------------------------
Quick search
------------------------------
To quickly search for simulations including a specific SARS-CoV-2 protein, the user can just input the protein name (e.g. Spike, NSP3, ...) into the search bar on the Home_ page. Alternatively, the user can select a protein of interest from the interactive graphical representation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, also found on the Home_ page. 

In both cases, the user will be redirected to a table with all the simulations that include the selected protein. Click on "Open" to visualize and analyze the simulation with our Workbench_ page. There, you will also find the details of the simulation, as well as links to download the simulation data.

------------------------------

Our Browse_ page provides an easy and quick tool to search for any simulation in our platform. Use the `Search` input to filter out the simulations shown in the table. It is possible to search by any of the terms included in the table (Included proteins, Uniprot entry name, Uniprot ID, etc.). 

The table rows contain a summary of the most important features of the simulations. This includes links to further details of the receptor and molecules present in the simulated system. Click on "Open" to visualize and analyze the simulation with our Workbench_ page. There, you will also find the details of the simulation, as well as links to download the simulation data.
