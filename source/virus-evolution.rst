Virus evolution
==================

In the *Virus evolution* section of the Home_ page, the user will find a visualization tool for viral phylogenetic data, extracted from GISAID_. This tool allows tracking SARS-CoV-2 isolates by region, gender, age, etc. as well as follow the emergence of mutations as a function of time. Each circle in the tree reflects one entry for a viral genome (isolate). By clicking on a viral genome, the user will find more information about it. Also, if the genome includes novel mutations that imply an amino acid change, the user can directly investigate the variant location on the 3D structure of implicated viral proteins as well as stream time-resolved dynamics on the fly.
